#### Credit-risk-classification
## Module 20 Challenge
For this challenge various techniques were used to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company was used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
A y label was created from the "loan_status" column, then the features x label was created with the remaining columns in the DataFrame.

## Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
A logisitc regression model was used by training the data then saving the predictions for testing data labelsand fitting the model.

The model's performance was evaluated by calculating the accuracy score of each model and prinitng a confusion matrix as shown in the classification reports. 


## Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
The brief report includes a summary and analsis of the performance of each machine learning model.
